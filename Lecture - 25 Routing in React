React Router Installation
React contains three different packages for routing. These are:
react-router: It provides the core routing components and functions for the React Router applications.
react-router-native: It is used for mobile applications.
react-router-dom: It is used for web applications design.
$ npm install react-router-dom --save 

Example
Step-1: In our project, we will create two more components along with App.js, which is already present.

About.js
import React from 'react'  
class About extends React.Component {  
  render() {  
    return <h1>About</h1>  
  }  
}  
export default About  

Contact.js

import React from 'react'  
class Contact extends React.Component {  
  render() {  
    return <h1>Contact</h1>  
  }  
}  
export default Contact 

App.js

import React from 'react'  
class App extends React.Component {  
  render() {  
    return (  
      <div>  
        <h1>Home</h1>  
      </div>  
    )  
  }  
}  
export default App
