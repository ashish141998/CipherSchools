React.js is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UI) in web applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of their applications. React follows a component-based architecture, where the user interface is divided into independent, self-contained components that can be composed together to build complex UIs.
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
